## Palmer Penguins Toy Analysis (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

This repository will eventually contain an end-to-end toy analysis that starts with very basic pre-processing of the raw Palmer Penguins data, then makes two plots of bill length vs bill depth visualizing the within-species bill length-depth relationship and the overall bill length-depth relationship to demonstrate Simpson's Paradox.
